TODO
Gradle has some defualt properties/methos, some of them are listed bellow.
* Modify the current task, adding all the listed and missed properties/methods.
* Add to the code two different properties to the task and print them, They can be int or string.

There are 2 alternatives to pass a property value to gradle.
	1. passing the property value through the command line gradle -b someFile.build -PstudenName="Benito Juárez"
	2. mention the second option and fix the code.
