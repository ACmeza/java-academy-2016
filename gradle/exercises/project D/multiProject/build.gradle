/*
TODO: Multi project. Let's say that we are creating a web application.
which consist of 3 modules, each module is developed by 3 different teams in your company.
Let's generate the jar and the war files for each module.

* Fix the errors, add the code required to generate the required files: 
(daoModule-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT.jar, serviceModule-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT.jar, webModule-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT.war)
Assume that each module has some java files, properties, jsp... and other files.
the jar files will be empty, no worries. :D
