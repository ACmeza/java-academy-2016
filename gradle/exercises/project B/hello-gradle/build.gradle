* What are the tasks defined in the 'java' plug-in?, list them.
* Create a jar file implmenting the 'java' plugin.
	remember that the 'java' plugin requires a folder structure where it can find the java code and other files. 
	if you don't remember the folder structure required, feel free to override the 'sourceSets' method which allow you to define the folder paths.

* declare the HelloGradle.java as the main class.
* execute the command  java -jar build\libs\hello-gradle.jar
